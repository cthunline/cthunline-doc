# Introduction

## What is Cthunline?

Cthunline is an open-source roleplaying game web app that you can self-host.

It's designed to provide useful tools to play RPG with your friends such as:

📝 Character sheets (they're pretty)

🎲 Dice rolls (obviously)

🎵 Jukebox (game master can play audio to everyone)

✏️ Sketch (draw things, display images and small tokens)

📓 Notes (remember important stuff)

## What games can I play with it?

For now there are a few games implemented:

🐙 Call of Cthulhu (7th edition)

🚀 Star Wars (D6 edition)

🐲 Dungeons & Dragons (5th edition)

🏴‍☠️️ 7th Sea (2nd edition)

More to come...

## Why is it named like that?

Cthunline is a mix between Cthulhu and Online. I know, that's odd.
